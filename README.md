# Placement_practice_code
These some of the coding tasks I completed in my first few months on placement to practice different python skills to prepare me for the larger project.

## Activity Calculator
I was asked to write some code that for a given radioactive isotope, initial activity and decay time calculated the activity at said decay time. The csv file I was given (half_lives.txt) included the name of the nuclide, its half life and the corresponding unit which was either years, days, minutes or seconds.
The challenge was to read the file in and then for the given nuclide convert the unit to seconds, calculate the decay constant then finally calculate the activity.
